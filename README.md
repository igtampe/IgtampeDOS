# IgtampeDOS
A *really* old project I worked on when I was 13 all the way to 2016. Got a lot of experience coding thanks to it, and I probably wouldn't handle VB.NET and Java as well as I do without it. I feel I owe it the respect of at least putting it here.

It's not really an OS, its just a batch file that *looks* like one. IDK Why I made it and why I took it so far, but I did, and I'm glad I did so.

IGTAMPE DOS

Igtampe DOS was a Small Project by IGTAMPE to Provide a Command
Prompt for those who don't have one. Certain Companies and Schools
Restrict access to the Command Prompt. Igtampe DOS solves that problem.
By masking itself as a Program, It asks the user for input, and then
executes it. A basic Command processor. At least, it was. Soon Igtampe DOS
Grew to be an Expansive command processor. A Feature list is denoted bellow.

FEATURES:

	-Basic Command Processing
	-Basic Compatibility with Windows 2000 Plus
	-Compatibility with Windows Vista or above
	-A Logging System

	-And some more things i Guess...
